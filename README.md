# About me
Hi, I'm Marius Oechslein. 
Currently I'm doing an AI master program and working as an AI engineer working student on the side in Bavaria, Germany.
I'm passionate about AI, Software Engineering, and Data Science.

In this technical blog I want to showcase the AI projects I'm working on in my studies and outside of it.
