# About me
Currently I'm doing an AI master program and working as an AI engineer working student on the side in Bavaria, Germany.
I'm passionate about Data Science, AI, and Software Engineering.

In this personal blog I want to showcase the AI projects I'm working on in my studies and outside of it.
